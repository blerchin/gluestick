The infrastructure for a graphDB based web framework. Right now just a proof-of concept with limited functionality - a GUI for structured data in the graph database Neo4j. Eventually this will be a web framework of some sort, but it's been on the back-burner for a while.  It uses a mind-map like interface to display and edit text and image data. Layouts are computed based on the significance of links established between various bits of content.
